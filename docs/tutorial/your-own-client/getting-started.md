# Getting Started

The [`fl-demonstrator-client`][1] package is specifically designed to support the development of Federated Learning clients inside the DLR Federated
Learning Ecosystem, providing a range of tools and convenient features to streamline the process.
It should be noted that this package is not really required or necessary, but by e.g. handling all the communication
parts, it allows you to focus on the unique aspects of your client, speeding up development time and reducing the
potential for errors.
The following MNIST example project is also using this package.
